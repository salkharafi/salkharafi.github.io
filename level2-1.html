<div>Self knowledge equated to the encyclopedia
and perceived facts, products of personal reasoning
the efficacy<br><br> of thoughts should not be <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;q&nbsp;u&nbsp;e&nbsp;s&nbsp;t&nbsp;i&nbsp;o&nbsp;n&nbsp;e&nbsp;d</div><br>
and assumptions simply made real and absolute

Typical of such a thought<br><br> stamps on convictions that
the banana<br><br> and plantain are the same
<br><br>a superior race surely exist<br><br>
leg size has a great correlation with the male’s genital<br><br>
the measure of one’s success<br><br> is solely factored<br><br>
in <br><br>his<br><br> accumulation <br><br>of<br><br> w &nbsp;e &nbsp;a &nbsp;l &nbsp;t &nbsp;h<br><br>
and money is the root of all evil.

This mindset can walk on hot coal just to prove these points
Columbus was the first European to visit the Americas
bulls are colour blind and bats are completely blind
women are subordinates to men
and a pure heart is one which covers its body from head to toe

This mind can even tear its clothes to rags
in displeasure to your opposition to issues such as
Sydney is Australia’s capital
the earth’s evolution is the cause of day and night
Africa is a country and its inhabitants exchange
morning greetings with the Lion and the Chimpanzee
and Neil Armstrong is the first human to journey into out space

Despite carrying the internet even to the dreams
and having global captions mixed with daily breath
assumptions such as these are nurtured
religiously, with rigidity and military acceptance
the biggest illiterate of the 21st century is one
who cannot learn, unlearn and relearn
so said Alvin Toffler, the Australian Educationist.
Oh sorry! The American futurist
